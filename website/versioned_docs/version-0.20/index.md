Apify command-line interface (Apify CLI) helps you create, develop, build and run [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/actors), and manage the Apify platform from any computer.

## What are Apify Actors?

Actors are cloud programs that can perform arbitrary web scraping, automation or data processing job. They accept input, perform their job and generate output.

## Why use Apify CLI?

The Apify CLI enables you to develop Actors locally on your computer using your preferred tools:

- Your favorite code editor
- Version control system
- Development tools and workflows

This gives you full control over your development environment and makes it easier to work on complex projects. You can leverage the [Apify SDK](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-js) with all its powerful features, then push your Actor to the Apify platform for deployment when ready.

:::note Actor development environment

Actors run in Docker containers on the Apify platform. With an appropriate `Dockerfile`, you can build Actors in any programming language. We recommend JavaScript/Node.js and Python, for which we have the most comprehensive libraries and support.
