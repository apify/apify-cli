<!-- actor-deploy-commands-start -->
<!-- actor-deploy-commands-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Actor Builds

Use these commands to manage actor build processes. They help you create, monitor, and maintain versioned snapshots of your actors that can be executed on the Apify platform.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- actor-build-commands-start -->
<!-- actor-build-commands-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Actor Runs

These commands control actor execution on the Apify platform. Use them to start, monitor, and manage actor runs, including accessing logs and handling execution states.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- actor-run-commands-start -->
<!-- actor-run-commands-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Storage

These commands manage data storage on the Apify platform. Use them to work with datasets, key-value stores, and request queues for persistent data storage and retrieval.

### Datasets

Use these commands to manage datasets, which provide structured storage for tabular data. They enable creation, modification, and data manipulation within datasets.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- dataset-commands-start -->

<!-- keyval-commands-start -->
<!-- keyval-commands-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Request Queues

These commands manage request queues, which handle URL processing for web scraping and automation tasks. Use them to maintain lists of URLs with automatic retry mechanisms and state management.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- reqqueue-commands-start -->
<!-- reqqueue-commands-end -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Tasks

These commands help you manage scheduled and configured actor runs. Use them to create, modify, and execute predefined actor configurations as tasks.
