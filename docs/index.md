Apify command-line interface (Apify CLI) helps you create, develop, build and run [Apify Actors](https://apify.com/actors), and manage the Apify cloud platform from any computer.

Apify Actors are cloud programs that can perform arbitrary web scraping, automation or data processing job. They accept input, perform their job and generate output. The Apify CLI enables you to develop Actors locally on your computer using your preferred code editor, version control system, and development tools. This approach gives you full control over your development environment, makes it easier to work on complex projects, and allows you to leverage the [Apify SDK](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-js) with all its powerful features. When you're ready, simply push your Actor to the Apify cloud for deployment.

:::note Actor Development Environment

Actors running on the Apify platform are executed in Docker containers, so with an appropriate `Dockerfile` you can build your Actors in any programming language. However, we recommend using JavaScript/Node.js and Python, for which we provide most libraries and support.
