Apify collects telemetry data about general usage of CLI to help us improve the product.
Participation in this program is optional, and you may opt-out if you'd not like to share any information.

## How is the data collected

We currently collect the following metrics:

- Usage of commands except `secrets` commands.
- Templates used for `actor create` command.

All telemetry data are collected and stored securely on Mixpanel.

## How to opt-out

To opt out of telemetry, set the `APIFY_CLI_TELEMETRY_DISABLE` environment variable to 1 or true.
